## 1. Technical Foundation Architecture

### 1.1 WebSocket Real-Time Communication System

**Algorithm: Real-Time Event Distribution**
```
INITIALIZE WebSocket Server
FOR each client connection:
    AUTHENTICATE user session
    SUBSCRIBE to relevant channels (property_updates, chat, notifications)
    MAINTAIN connection heartbeat every 30 seconds

EVENT HANDLING:
    IF property_status_change:
        BROADCAST to all subscribed clients
        UPDATE database with timestamp
        LOG activity for analytics
    
    IF user_inquiry:
        ROUTE to appropriate agent
        STORE in conversation database
        TRIGGER automated response if agent offline
```

**Implementation Standards:**
- Use Socket.IO for cross-browser compatibility
- Implement connection pooling for scalability (Redis adapter)
- Rate limiting: 100 messages per minute per user
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Message queuing for offline users

**Performance Metrics:**
- Connection establishment: <200ms
- Message delivery: <50ms
- Concurrent connections: 10,000+ users
- Uptime requirement: 99.9%

### 1.2 Email Capture & Automation Pipeline

**Algorithm: Lead Scoring & Nurturing**
```
EMAIL_CAPTURE_PROCESS:
    VALIDATE email format and domain
    CHECK against existing database
    IF new_lead:
        ASSIGN initial score = 50
        TRIGGER welcome sequence
        ADD to appropriate segment
    
SCORING_ALGORITHM:
    base_score = 50
    FOR each action:
        property_view = +5 points
        saved_property = +10 points
        mortgage_calc_use = +15 points
        contact_form = +25 points
        phone_call_request = +30 points
    
    IF score > 80: HOT_LEAD
    IF score 50-80: WARM_LEAD
    IF score < 50: COLD_LEAD

AUTOMATION_TRIGGERS:
    Day 1: Welcome email + Property recommendations
    Day 3: Market insights newsletter
    Day 7: Personalized agent introduction
    Day 14: Similar properties alert
    Day 30: Market report + Check-in
```

**Technical Stack:**
- SendGrid/Mailgun for email delivery
